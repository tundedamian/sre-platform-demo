# Architecture Design

## System Overview

This SRE platform demo implements a microservices architecture with comprehensive monitoring, logging, and deployment capabilities. The system is designed to be production-ready with high availability, scalability, and observability. Key production-grade features include database/service replication, clustering, and horizontal scaling to ensure continuous operation and performance under load.

## Component Architecture

### Application Layer

The application layer consists of:
- **API Gateway**: Manages incoming requests and routes to appropriate services
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization

- **Data Service**: Manages data access and business rules

### Data Layer

The data layer includes:
- **Primary Database**: Persistent storage for application data with master-slave replication for high availability
- **Database Clustering**: Clustered database setup with automatic failover and load distribution
- **Cache Layer**: Redis with clustering and replication for caching frequently accessed data
- **Message Queue**: Asynchronous processing with RabbitMQ/Kafka clusters for durability and scalability

### Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer provides:
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes for container management with clustering and auto-scaling
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic service registration and discovery
- **Load Balancing**: Traffic distribution across services with health checks
- **Security**: Network policies and firewalls

## Monitoring Architecture

### Metrics Collection

- **Prometheus**: Centralized metrics collection
- **Node Exporters**: System-level metrics from all nodes
- **Application Metrics**: Custom business metrics

- **Request Context**: Propagation of trace IDs across service boundaries
- **Performance Analysis**: Identification of bottlenecks
- **Dependency Mapping**: Visualization of service interactions

## Deployment Architecture

### CI/CD Pipeline

The pipeline includes:
1. **Source Control**: Git with protected branches
2. **Build Stage**: Container image creation
3. **Testing Stage**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
4. **Staging Environment**: Pre-production validation
5. **Production Deployment**: Automated with safety checks

### Deployment Strategies

- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual traffic shifting
- **Rolling Updates**: Incremental service updates
- **Feature Flags**: Decoupled feature releases

## Security Architecture

### Network Security

- **Network Policies**: Kubernetes network policies for service isolation
- **Service Mesh**: Istio/Linkerd for secure service communication
- **Firewalls**: Ingress control and security groups

### Authentication & Authorization

- **OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect**: Standard authentication protocols
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained permission management
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of sensitive information

## Resilience Architecture

### Circuit Breakers

- **Service-to-Service Communication**: Prevent cascading failures
- **Timeout Management**: Proper request timeout handling
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation strategies

### Clustering and Replication for Resilience

- **Database Clustering**: Multi-node database clusters with automatic failover
- **Service Replication**: Multiple service instances with health monitoring
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Geographic replication for disaster recovery
- **Stateful Service Replication**: Replication of stateful services with data synchronization

### Chaos Engineering

- **Failure Injection**: Proactive failure testing
- **Recovery Validation**: Verification of recovery procedures
- **Monitoring Validation**: Ensure metrics detect failures

## Scaling Architecture

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

- **CPU/Memory Based**: Automatic scaling based on resource usage
- **Custom Metrics**: Scaling based on application-specific metrics
- **Cluster Autoscaling**: Node scaling based on pod resource demands
- **Replica Management**: Automatic management of pod replicas with minimum and maximum bounds

### Service Clustering & Replication

- **Database Replication**: Master-slave and multi-master database replication for data durability
- **Service Clustering**: Clustered services with automatic failover capabilities
- **StatefulSets**: Proper management of stateful services requiring persistent storage
- **Multi-Zone Deployment**: Distribution across multiple availability zones for high availability

### Load Distribution

- **Service Load Balancing**: Internal service communication
- **External Load Balancing**: Traffic distribution from clients
- **Geolocation Routing**: Geographic load distribution
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient resource utilization through connection pooling

## Backup and Recovery

### Data Protection

- **Regular Backups**: Automated backup of critical data
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Restoration to specific moments
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Geographic redundancy through active-active clusters
- **Continuous Data Protection**: Real-time replication and backup mechanisms

### Disaster Recovery

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Target time for system recovery
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss
- **Failover Procedures**: Automated or manual failover capabilities
- **Multi-Region Clustering**: Active-active clusters across multiple regions for seamless failover
- **Disaster Recovery Testing**: Regular testing of failover and recovery procedures

## Infrastructure as Code

### Terraform Modules
