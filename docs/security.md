# Security Practices

This document outlines the security implementation and best practices in the SRE Platform Demo, encompassing infrastructure security, application security, and operational security measures.

## Security-by-Design Principles

### Zero Trust Model
- No implicit trust based on network location
- Continuous verification of all service communications
- Principle of least privilege for all components

### Defense in Depth
- Multiple security layers to protect resources
- Network segmentation and isolation
- Redundant security controls

### Security Automation
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code with security policies
- Automated security testing and compliance checks

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security
- **Network Policies**: Kubernetes network policies restrict traffic between namespaces and services
- **Firewall Rules**: Restrict ingress and egress traffic based on security requirements
- **VPC/Subnet Isolation**: Isolate services in private subnets with public gateway access

### Container Security
- **Image Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of container images
- **Minimal Base Images**: Use minimal, official base images to reduce attack surface
- **Non-root Execution**: Run containers as non-root users
- **Read-only Root Filesystem**: Where possible, use read-only root filesystems

### Kubernetes Security
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained access control for Kubernetes resources
- **Pod Security Policies**: Restrict privileged containers and capabilities
- **Secrets Management**: Encrypt and properly manage sensitive information
- **API Server Security**: Secure API server with authentication and authorization

### Infrastructure as Code Security
- **Terraform Security Scanning**: Use tools like tfsec or Checkov to scan infrastructure code
- **State File Security**: Encrypt Terraform state files and store securely
- **Remote State Backend**: Use secure remote backend with access controls

## Application Security

### Authentication and Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect**: Industry-standard authentication protocols
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions based on user roles
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enhanced security for administrative access

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and DoS attacks through rate limiting
- **API Gateway Security**: Centralized security controls at the gateway
- **Input Validation**: Validate all input to prevent injection attacks
- **Output Sanitization**: Sanitize output to prevent XSS attacks

### Data Security
- **Encryption at Rest**: Encrypt sensitive data stored in databases
- **Encryption in Transit**: Use TLS/SSL for all communications
- **Data Classification**: Identify and handle sensitive data appropriately
- **Secure Key Management**: Use cloud key management services for encryption keys

## Secrets Management

### Secret Storage
- **HashiCorp Vault**: Centralized secrets management
- **Cloud Secret Managers**: AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, or Azure Key Vault
- **Kubernetes Secrets**: Encrypted storage for Kubernetes-native secrets

### Secret Rotation
- **Automated Rotation**: Regular, automated rotation of secrets
- **Compromise Response**: Procedures for secret rotation in case of compromise
- **Least Frequency**: Rotate secrets at appropriate intervals based on sensitivity

### Access Controls
- **Need-to-Know**: Limit access to secrets based on job requirements
- **Auditing**: Log and monitor access to secrets
- **Time-Bounded Access**: Temporary access grants when possible

## CI/CD Pipeline Security

### Code Security
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Training and guidelines for secure coding
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static Code Analysis**: Automated detection of security vulnerabilities

### Pipeline Security
- **Privilege Segregation**: Separate privileges for build and deployment stages
- **Artifact Integrity**: Ensure integrity of build artifacts
- **Secure Configuration**: Protect pipeline configuration from tampering

### Deployment Security
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Deployments do not modify existing infrastructure
- **Golden Images**: Use pre-built, secure, scanned images
- **Security Gates**: Automated security checks before production deployment

## Monitoring and Logging Security

### Security Event Monitoring
- **SIEM Integration**: Security Information and Event Management
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automated detection of unusual patterns
- **Threat Detection**: Integration with threat intelligence feeds

### Secure Logging
- **Log Integrity**: Protect logs from tampering
- **Secure Retention**: Secure storage and retention of logs for compliance
- **Sensitive Data Masking**: Prevent logging of sensitive information

### Audit Trails
- **Comprehensive Auditing**: Track all privileged operations
- **Immutable Logs**: Prevent modification of audit logs
- **Regular Review**: Regular review of audit trails

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Response Plan
- **Classification**: Standardized classification of security incidents
- **Response Procedures**: Step-by-step incident response procedures
- **Communication Plan**: Internal and external communication protocols
- **Post-Incident Review**: Analysis and improvement after incidents

### Runbooks for Security Events
- **Malware Detection**: Procedures for handling malware detection
- **Data Breach**: Response to potential data breaches
- **Account Compromise**: Handling compromised accounts
- **Network Intrusion**: Response to network intrusions

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Frameworks
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Implementation of NIST guidelines
- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management system

### Compliance Requirements
- **SOC 2**: Service Organization Control 2 compliance
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation adherence
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (if applicable)

## Security Testing

### Vulnerability Management
- **Regular Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of infrastructure
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration testing of systems
- **Bug Bounty Program**: External security testing program

### Security Testing in CI/CD
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Runtime vulnerability detection
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Code-level vulnerability detection
- **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)**: Hybrid security testing

## Security Training and Awareness

### Team Education
- **Security Training**: Regular training on security best practices
- **Phishing Awareness**: Training to recognize and report phishing attempts
- **Incident Response Training**: Regular drills and training exercises

### Security Culture
- **Security Champions**: Designated security advocates in each team
- **Security Reviews**: Regular security reviews of new features and changes
- **Lessons Learned**: Sharing security incidents and lessons across teams

This comprehensive security approach ensures that security is embedded throughout the SRE Platform Demo.
