# Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

This document defines the Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for the SRE Platform Demo, along with error budget policies and management practices.

## Overview

SLIs and SLOs are critical SRE practices that provide a quantitative basis for describing service reliability. They enable data-driven decision making about feature development, deployment, and resource allocation.

## Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

### Availability SLI
- **Definition**: Percentage of time the service successfully responds to requests
- **Formula**: Successful requests / Total requests
- **Measurement**: Tracked continuously via health check endpoints
- **Target**: 99.9% of requests should succeed over the measurement period

### Latency SLI
- **Definition**: Percentage of requests served within a specified time threshold
- **Formula**: Requests served within threshold / Total requests
- **Measurement**: End-to-end request duration including network overhead
- **Target**: 95% of requests served within 500ms over the measurement period

### Quality SLI
- **Definition**: Percentage of requests that return correct, non-error responses
- **Formula**: Successful responses / Total requests (excluding 4xx client errors)
- **Measurement**: Requests returning 2xx/3xx vs 5xx server errors
- **Target**: 99.5% of requests return successful responses over the measurement period

### Freshness SLI
- **Definition**: Maximum acceptable delay for data updates to become visible
- **Formula**: Time from data update to visibility / Data update frequency
- **Measurement**: Time from write to read consistency
- **Target**: Data updates visible within 60 seconds

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### Production SLOs (28-day rolling window)

#### Primary Service SLOs
- **Availability**: 99.9% (max 4.32 minutes downtime per month)
- **Latency**: 95th percentile < 500ms (95% of requests served within 500ms)
- **Quality**: 99.5% success rate for server-side errors

#### Secondary Service SLOs
- **Data Freshness**: 99% of data updates visible within 60 seconds
- **Recovery Time**: Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) < 15 minutes for P0 incidents

### Staging SLOs
- **Availability**: 99% (for validation purposes)
- **Latency**: 90th percentile < 1000ms
- **Quality**: 99% success rate

## Error Budget

### Error Budget Calculation
- **Availability Error Budget**: (100% - SLO) = (100% - 99.9%) = 0.1%
- **Latency Error Budget**: (100% - SLO) = (100% - 95%) = 5%
- **Quality Error Budget**: (100% - SLO) = (100% - 99.5%) = 0.5%

### Error Budget Policy
- When error budget consumption reaches 50%: Increase monitoring and alerting focus
- When error budget consumption reaches 90%: All non-critical feature development pauses
- When error budget consumption reaches 100%: Only reliability improvements allowed

### Error Budget Consumption Monitoring
- Real-time tracking via dedicated dashboard
- Automated alerts when consumption thresholds are reached
- Weekly error budget burn rate reports

## SLO Measurement Periods

### Rolling Windows
- **Daily**: For rapid feedback and alerting
- **7-day**: For weekly trend analysis
- **28-day**: Primary SLO measurement period (aligns with industry standards)

### Alerting Windows
- **Immediate**: Critical issues (availability < 95% for 2 minutes)
- **Short-term**: Short-term degradation (availability < 99% for 5 minutes)
- **Long-term**: SLO violations (availability < 99.9% over 28 days)

## SLO Budget Allocation

### Feature Development vs Reliability
- **60%** of capacity for feature development
- **20%** for reliability improvements and technical debt
- **10%** for operational overhead
- **10%** for error budget consumption

### Alert Prioritization
- **P0**: SLO violations that risk budget consumption
- **P1**: Issues that impact SLO achievement
- **P2**: Potential SLO risks
- **P3**: Non-SLO impacting issues

## SLO Implementation

### Prometheus Queries for SLO Measurement

#### Availability SLO
```promql
sum(rate(http_requests_total{code=~"5.."}[5m])) by (service) / 
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (service) < 0.001
```

#### Latency SLO
```promql
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, service)) < 0.5
```

#### Quality SLO
```promql
sum(rate(http_requests_total{code=~"5.."}[5m])) by (service) / 
sum(rate(http_requests_total{code=~"2..|3..|5.."}[5m])) by (service) < 0.005
```

### SLO Dashboard Components
- Real-time SLO compliance view
- Error budget consumption charts
- Historical SLO performance trends
- SLO burn rate analysis

## SLO Reporting

### SLO Reports
- **Weekly SLO Reports**: Performance against objectives
- **Monthly SLO Reviews**: Trend analysis and improvement planning
- **Quarterly SLO Assessments**: Strategic alignment review

### SLO Documentation
- Link to relevant runbooks for SLO violations
- Clear ownership structure for each SLO
- Escalation procedures for SLO breaches

## SLO Maintenance

### Regular SLO Review
- Quarterly SLO reviews to ensure alignment with business objectives
- Adjustment based on service maturity and user expectations
- Consideration of seasonality and usage patterns

### SLO Health Checks
- Monthly validation of SLO measurement accuracy
- Verification of alert thresholds and notification mechanisms
- Review of error budget calculation methods

## Business Impact

### SLO-Driven Decision Making
- Feature development prioritization based on error budget
- Release approval process tied to SLO compliance
- Resource allocation based on SLO performance

### Customer Communication
- Service status page aligned with SLOs
- Customer communication during SLO violations
- Transparency in service reliability reporting

This SLO framework ensures that reliability is quantified, communicated, and managed effectively in the SRE Platform Demo.
